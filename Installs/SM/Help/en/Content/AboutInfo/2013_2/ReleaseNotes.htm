            <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                <p style="text-align: left;">The report header has been updated and now looks similar in all reports. It displays information about the company, store and sometimes terminals and staff, when and by whom the report is printed and for which period it is valid. The look of the report tables has also been synchronized and some charts have been added where relevant.</p>
                <p class="heading">Reports in Default Data</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/About/2013_2/ReportChart.png" class="imgright" />The following reports are included in the report data package:</p>

            <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                <p>Functionality to create form profiles has been added to the Site Manager. In the Site Manager there will always be one Default form profile that will be used if no other profiles are created or used in the system. When upgrading a database that already has receipt forms, these will all be included in the Default form profile automatically but new, empty databases will have an empty Default form profile.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">The custom profiles do not need to include all the different forms available in the system but only the forms that should be different for each store. The forms that are in the default profile will be used if they are not included in the custom profile.<img src="../../Resources/Images/About/2013_2/FormProfileView.png" /></p>
                <p>On the store card (Form settings) the specific form profile can be selected for the store as well as a logo for the receipts</p>

                <p class="heading">Form Layout Export/Import</p>
                <p>Forms in the Edit form list view (Form and labels) can now be exported and imported into the Site Manager for easier maintenance and fixes at customer site. The file extension for the exported file will be .form.</p>

            <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                <p>The form editor itself has gone through some interface changes.</p>
                <p>The parameters that can be added to the form have been categorized within header, lines and footer. By clicking on the Zoom in button available in each section that section is maximized for a better view and to make it easier to edit. The “variables” also have another color to make them easier to see as well as many other usability changes.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/About/2013_2/FormEditor.png" />
                </p>
                <p>Functionality to support all the different OPOS font types that can be available has also been added under an option called Font type in the editor. Please note that not all OPOS printers support all of these fonts and if the receipt is sent to a Windows printer, the text will not be printed using these fonts.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">

                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/About/2013_2/FormTypes.png" class="imgright" />A list of all the form types can be viewed now by going to Store setup, Forms and labels, Form types.</p>
                <p>New form types can be created by the partner to be used in any customizations needing printouts. By creating form types for any printouts, the Printing service and all variables available on the form layouts are available for any and all customizations.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p class="heading">New fields for forms
</p>
                <p>New fields have been added to the Store card (Form settings) and Terminal card (Settings). The fields are Form info 1 through 4. These fields are generic text fields and can be used to add either store specific or terminal specific info to forms.

                <p>Some hospitality improvements were done in this release which is mostly centered on making the hospitality perform better and make it easier for the POS to switch users.</p>
                <ul class="release">
                    <li class="release" value="1">The POS is now much quicker to go from the table view to the POS than before. The POS was taking too long to redraw in previous releases.</li>
                    <li class="release" value="2">A new configuration has been added to the Hospitality tab on the terminal; “Switch user when entering POS”. If selected, the user is prompted for a user name and password when entering a table from the table view. By using this functionality the user does not need to completely log out of the POS and the table view can be displayed on the POS in between taking orders.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                <ul class="release">
                    <li class="release" value="1">Printing station was not using the configured character set.</li>
                    <li class="release" value="2">If the printing to the kitchen was not successful, the items were still marked as printed.</li>
                    <li class="release" value="3">If the configuration “Log out after each transaction” was selected in Hospitality the POS logged the user out when going from the POS to the table view.</li>
                    <li class="release" value="4">Kitchen printing slip now prints user name not staff ID.</li>
                    <li class="release" value="5">If the user selected to pay, then cancelled the printing dialog and also cancelled the payment dialog the items could not be printed in later operations.</li>
                    <li class="release" value="6">Printing station setup usability fixes.</li>
                    <li class="release" value="7">Hospitality types view was displaying sales type ID not description.</li>

            <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                <p>New operation Loyalty Points Discount has been added to the POS. This functionality allows the user to get a discount of items by using loyalty points instead of using the points to pay for the items. This discount works in the same way as a total discount and any items added after the point discount operation is run will not get this discount but it can be updated later in the sale.</p>
                <p>The amount of the discount can be limited by the “Use points limit” set on the loyalty scheme and this discount will only be added to items that do not already have a discount and items that have this discount will not get other discounts.</p>
                <p>If a loyalty points discount has been added to the sale, a payment with loyalty points cannot be used and vice versa.</p>
                <p>The loyalty points discount information is printed in the Line discount fields on the item. In order to get the text “Point discount” on the receipt, the variable Line discount name needs to be used instead of Line discount text.</p>

                    <li class="release" value="1">When accruing points, all points are rounded down to the next integer and when paying with points or using them as discount, the points are rounded up to the next integer.</li>
                    <li class="release" value="2">Receipt printing displays all points without decimals.</li>

                <p>When the database is upgraded, all the existing touch button layouts, styles and menu headers are given unique IDs and if the same data is being imported into a database that already has these IDs, the user will be asked if this data should be overwritten, copied or if the operation should be canceled.</p>

            <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                <p>In previous versions, the POS always reloaded and emptied the so-called Application lifetime cache at logoff. It didn’t matter if the user clicked the Logoff button, was automatically logged off or the POS was logging off after each transaction. After that all settings and profiles were reloaded and the Application lifetime cache was cleared. In this release we’ve added a configuration on the Functionality profile to control this.</p>
                <p>The settings that are available are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Never – these settings are never reloaded and the Application lifetime cache is never cleared during the running of the application.</li>
                    <li value="2">On log out + minutes: The user needs to have been logged out for a specific number of minutes for this information to be reloaded.</li>
                    <li value="3">When logged out – the functionality as it was before</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The default configuration that will be active after an upgrade is that these settings are reloaded and the cache cleared if the user has been logged out for more than 60 minutes.</p>

                    <li value="3">When scanning in a customer barcode into the POS if parsing the barcode mask does not find the customer the customer card information is also searched.

When two Site service profiles are set; only the table management uses the Store Site service, which should be run locally on the Store, but all other centralized functions selected in the Head office profile go through the Head office site service. This functionality was not working perfectly and has been fixed.</li>
                    <li value="4">When POS was started in hospitality mode with table layout and then the user logged out without entering the POS an error was displayed. This has now been fixed.</li>

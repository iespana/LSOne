        <h1>Other Improvements</h1>
        <p>One change that was done in this release is to add a „Deleted“ flag to all items. If an item is deleted it is not removed from the database but rather marked as deleted. A filter on the retail items view can display all deleted items. This means that all reports will still be able to display information about items that have been „deleted“ and the users can remove items that are not being used anymore from their retail items list even if they have sales associated with them.</p>
        <p>In this release LS One will only support SQL Server version 2014 and all LS One installers will only include a setup for SQL Server 2014.</p>

            <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">When returning transactions (locally or through central returns) if any of the items selected for return where then voided they are now not marked as return.</li>
                    <li value="2">An error with infocodes configured to trigger at start of transaction but only on item sale in Functionalty profile has now been fixed.</li>
                    <li value="3">When adding an income/expense account item to the transaction the POS could not print the receipt as an error was thrown.</li>
                    <li value="4">When the POS starts itself up and a receipt printer is connected to the POS an empty line will now be printed but the printer will not cut the paper.</li>
                    <li value="5">LS One POS has to have a write permission to folder C:\ProgramData\LS Retail\LS POS so that the license can be activated. If the POS does not have this write permission a message is now displayed to the user.</li>
                    <li value="6">When the user tried to change the quantity of an item or a linked item an error message with a number was displayed instead of the actual error text.</li>
                    <li value="7">When displaying images in the item search dialog and the user scrolled down many pages the POS would become unresponsive.</li>
                    <li value="8">Touch scroll has been implemented in the employee list option in the logon process.</li>
                    <li value="9">Offline_EFT_Dropdown.dll for offline card handling is no longer hardcoded to use payment type with ID = 3.</li>
                    <li value="10">When scanning in a customer barcode into the POS if parsing the barcode mask does not find the customer the customer card information is also searched. This means that a full barcode string can be attached to a customer through the Customer card option in Site Manager.</li>
                    <li value="11">Discount price is now set and loyalty points recalculated when returning a transaction with loyalty discount.</li>
                    <li value="12">POS will now accept multiple payments and tenders when items and transactions are being returned. Payment types can be excluded from being used in returns by setting a configuration in "Allowed payment types".</li>
                    <li value="13">When entering more than 17 digits in the numpad a "Unidentified error" was displayed to the user. This has now been fixed.</li>
                    <li value="14">
                        <p>Site service no longer saves customer deposit locally if no connection can be made to site service and central customers is turned on. Message is displayed instead.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="15">Small keyboard input field that can be placed on Touch button layout now keeps focus like the barcode/qty field on the large numpad.</li>
                    <li value="16">Customer selection infocode now adds customer to transaction.</li>
                    <li value="17">
                        <p>A new receipt type has been created for gift receipt. Gift receipt is a receipt that can be printed for sales transactions on demand. The receipt can omit prices and can be used to exchanges gift items. When the receipt is printed items that should appear on it can be picked from the original transaction. I.e. not all items need to appear on the gift receipt.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="18">
                        <p>New operation has been added to LS One POS. The operation is called 'Reprint receipt' and it can be configured to print 4 different types for receipts. Gift receipt, receipt copy, tax free receipt and a custom receipt implemented by partner. This operation prints receipts of the selected type for the last transaction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li value="19">All loyalty fields are now only visible on receipt if there is a loyalty card on the transaction.</li>
                    <li value="20">User was able to sell the same gift card twice in the same transaction. This has now been prevented and a message is displayed that tells the user that the gift card in question has already been added to the transaction.</li>
                    <li value="21">
                        <p>Spinner is now displayed if it takes a time to retrieve transaction for return when using central returns.</p>
                    </li>

                <ul>

                    <li value="2">When an item is sold the current cost price is saved to field RboTransactionSalesTrans.CostAmount.</li>
                    <li value="3">When new database is created then POS settings for returns and discounts now have correct default values for the admin user.</li>
                    <li value="4">A migration functionality was created to move item information from old tables to the new tables created for the Variant framework. Before updating the database the Site Manager offers the user to backup the database</li>
                    <li value="5">When LS One POS is run in hospitality mode​ it has the option to set a Site service profile for Store and Head office. When two site service profiles are set only the table management uses the store Site service which should be run locally on the Store but all other centralized functions selected in the Head office profile go through the head office site service. This functionality was not working perfectly and has been fixed.</li>
                    <li value="6">A migration functionality was created to move item information from old tables to the new tables created for the Variant framework. Before updating the database the Site Manager offers the user to backup the database.</li>

        <h1>Other improvements</h1>
        <p>In this section smaller improvements and bugfixes for both the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span> and <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> are listed.</p>
        <h2>Receipt designer improvements</h2>
        <p>Variables to print out net total price with and without tax have been added to the Lines section of the receipt designer.</p>
        <p>Variable "Sum total transaction discount" was added to the Receipt designer</p>
        <h2><span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span> improvements</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Configuration changes and additions</h3>
        <p>Configuration to allow training mode has been removed from the <a href="../../FieldHelp/Store/StoreView.htm">store card</a> due to changes on how to activate the training mode (see <a href="POSImprovements.htm">here</a>)</p>
        <p>"Wrap around" functionality in <a href="../../FieldHelp/Administration/EditNumberSequenceDialog.htm">number sequences</a> has been removed.</p>
        <p>The logo size on the Form settings tab on the Store card has been changed from being a size in pixels to being a selection of Normal and Double</p>
        <p>An email field has been added to the <a href="../../FieldHelp/User/NewUserWizard.htm">new user dialog</a>. The email value can be edited from the <a href="../../FieldHelp/User/User.htm">POS settings tab</a> in the user view. This field is not mandatory when creating a new user</p>
        <p>A new setting has been added to the visual profile which controls how much space the payment lines use on the receipt control on LS One POS.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Data management</h3>
        <p>When deleting functionality, hardware or a visual profile the Site Manager now checks to see if the profile is being used anywhere and will not allow the profile to be deleted if it is being used</p>
        <p>When opening up scheduler jobs in the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span> and closing the view again without changing anything a change action was created so any jobs replicating the replication data between databases would have needlessly been run afterwards. This has now been fixed.</p>
        <p>Distribution locations for terminals now get a combined external ID of "&lt;store ID&gt;-&lt;terminal ID&gt;". This makes sure that the "Pull from POS" job works when you have more than one terminal with the same terminal ID.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor202"></a>Fixed a consistency issue between the vendor item and retail items imported from the demo data</p>

        <h3>User interface updates</h3>

        <p>When resetting a tax group in an item to be None (empty) the dialog to ask the user if the price should be recalculated was stuck underneath the combo box and could not be clicked. This has been fixed.</p>
        <p>When adding multiple items to a purchase order using the create another functionality, in some instances the unit combo box did not update itself to have the correct unit list for the new item selected. This has been fixed</p>
        <p>A bug has been fixed in Site Manager that prevented editing an existing 'mix and match' discount on an item. This has now been fixed.</p>

        <p>When creating a <a href="../../FieldHelp/Customer/NewCustomerDialog.htm">new customer</a>  the sales tax group is now saved if selected. Before the tax group was only saved when updated on the <a href="../../FieldHelp/Customer/CustomerView.htm">customer card</a>.</p>

        <p>A bug has been fixed where an error came up when expanding variants after sorting by retail group or department</p>

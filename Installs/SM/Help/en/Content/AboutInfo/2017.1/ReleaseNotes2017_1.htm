        <h1><b style="font-size: 16pt;">LS One 2017.1 – Ready to connect to any ERP!</b>
        </h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>It’s with great pleasure that the LS One team announces the release of LS One 2017.1. This version includes the much-anticipated Integration Framework (IF) that enables easy integration into any ERP solution. We have also updated our <a href="http://devhelp.ls-one.com/" target="_blank">Development Help</a> with many more examples and, now available online. Our commitment to omni-channel solutions continues to be a priority, and for this reason we have made some improvements to the Mobile POS. On the POS side, we have added Parked Inventory for returned items that need to be processed. We have also added Customer Quotes in support of Customer Orders to complete the workflow and better support integration with e-commerce platforms.</p>
        <h2>Integration Framework</h2>
        <p>LS One is becoming increasingly popular in the market as a system that can easily connect to ERP solutions. This capability has always been there, but it used to require much more coding from our partners. We have listened to your feedback, and responded by adding the Integration Framework. The framework supports basic entities like Customer, Vendor, Retail Items, Groups, Departments, Transactions and Statements to be synchronized between LS One and the parent ERP. We have also allowed for extensions to be made on our Site Service so that e.g. Inventory status can be retrieved from the ERP solution instead of the Site Manager.</p>
        <p>Please follow our exciting partnership with SAP B1, which will be built onto the Integration Framework.</p>
        <p>For more information see our <a href="IntegrationFramework.htm">release notes</a></p>
        <h2>Development Help</h2>
        <p>Our development has now followed the path of our product help: it is now available online at <a href="http://devhelp.ls-one.com/" target="_blank">http://devhelp.ls-one.com/</a> We have also added many more examples, to help partners build more, exciting extensions.</p>
        <h2>Mobile POS</h2>
        <p>The LS Omni team keeps adding new, exciting improvements to the mobile POS. Given our commitment to eventually support all LS Omni products, it was natural for us to include the new mobile POS and Omni server in LS One 2017.1.</p>
        <h2>Parked Inventory</h2>
        <p>When items are returned to the store, they should not be part of the available inventory. This is a feature RMS customers and partners are accustomed too. We are happy to announce this feature is now available in LS One. The Parked Inventory can also be found on each item’s Inventory status.</p>
        <p>For more information see our <a href="ParkedInventory.htm">release notes</a></p>
        <h2>POS Improvements</h2>
        <p>It’s now possible to see all customer-related purchases directly in the POS. Moreover, customer details can now be edited directly at the POS, not just in the Site Manager.</p>
        <p>All in all, this is a fantastic release, and we trust you will like it as much as we do. For more detailed information please see our release notes <a href="POSImprovements.htm">here</a> and <a href="OtherImprovements.htm">here</a>.</p>

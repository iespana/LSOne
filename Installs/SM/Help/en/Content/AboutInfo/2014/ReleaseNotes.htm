                <p>For items such as beer or wine which are sold in different size glasses or bottles but all have the same inventory unit, the POS can now request the POS user to enter which unit is being sold. So, when the item is sold, a dialog pops up where you can select a glass or a bottle of wine for an example.</p>

                <p class="heading">Stock counting</p>
                <p>Stock counting has been made easier. You can either export a stock counting lists which can be filled in and then imported again or the stock counting can be done within the Site Manager where the Stock counting dialog has been modified to be filled in more easily by enabling barcode scanning  and the entering of counted quantity.</p>
                <p class="heading">Transaction search in Site Manager</p>
                <p>The Search bar has been added to the Receipt browser in the Site Manager where you can search in all receipts with the following search parameters:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Date and time</li>

                    <li value="5">Terminal</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Also the total amount has been added to the list of receipts to help with the search.</p>

                <p class="heading">Authentication token login</p>
                <p>Both in the LS One POS and Site Manager, the authentication token logins are now not scanned directly into the Login field. But first you have to select the card login button and then scan you authentication token. This increases the security as the token number can be hidden to the user.</p>
                <p>The POS and Site Manager remembers the type of the last login and opens in the token login, if that was used to log in the last time.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/About/2014/login.png" />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Normal login screen at the POS â€“ The card button has been added.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/About/2014/tokenlogin.png" />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">The new token login â€“ there is a button to get back to the username and password login.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"><span class="Note">Note:</span> Employee card setup has been removed and the authentication token should be used instead. </p>
                <p class="heading">Numeric keypad</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">In the POS systems, numeric usernames and passwords are often used to speed up user login. On the small screens of some hardware it can be hard to enter the password on the touch-screen keyboard. </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/About/2014/keyboard_691x400.jpg" style="width: 691;height: 400;" />
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Now the user can switch to using numeric keypad to insert the username and password and the <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> remembers which was used for the last login. So if all users have numeric logins and passwords, the keyboard can always only have numbers. </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">

            <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                <p>LS One has been modified to fulfill the requirements of the WELMEC 2.2 guide for testing Point of Sale Devices connected with a Non-Automatic Weighing instrument. The certification process is in progress at the time of the release.</p>
                <p>These changes involve displaying units such as kg and $ or â‚¬ or all numbers shown on the POS screen, Customer displays and receipts. And some parts of the code that controls the connection to the scale, line display and printer have been locked with checksums. So if this code has been manipulated, a scale cannot be connected to the POS.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">

                </p>
                <p>The POS About dialog includes all version numbers, checksums and will include the scale test certificate number when the test certification process is done. The POS will also display the certification number in its status bar when a scale is connected to it. </p>

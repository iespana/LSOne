        <h1>Receipt changes and improvements</h1>
        <p>New sections and variables have been added to the Receipt designer as well as some new form types and layouts have been added. </p>
        <p>For more information on how this effects customizations and development please see the <a href="DevelopmentNotes2017.htm">Development release notes</a>.</p>
        <h2>Send the receipt with email</h2>
        <p>The <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> can now be configured to send receipts with email. If a customer is on the transaction the POS&#160;will listen to the Receipt options that are already available on the customers on how they want their receipts; Printed, email or both.</p>
        <p>The <span class="MyVariablesSite Service">Site Service</span> is used to send the receipts so the <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> in effect schedules a receipt to be emailed so the POS&#160;user or customer doesn't have to wait for the email to be sent. The <span class="MyVariablesSite Service">Site Service</span> configurations include the interval (in minutes)&#160;at which the emails will be sent by the <span class="MyVariablesSite Service">Site Service</span>. The minimum interval is 1 minute but the maximum is not defined. If the interval is set as 0 then emails are never sent.</p>
        <p>Please see more detailed information about the <a href="../../HelpTopics/EmailReceipts/EmailReceipts.htm">configuration and setup necessary in the online help</a>.</p>
        <p>The <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> can be configured to send the emails always, on request, only to customers and never. Please see more <a href="../../HelpTopics/EmailReceipts/EmailReceiptPOS.htm">detailed information in the online help</a>.</p>
        <h2>Receipt designer changes</h2>
        <p>A new section has been added to the Receipt designer for Tender removal information that can be used when designing a layout for the tender removal receipt. In previous releases the tender removal receipt was created in code and could not be changed. Now a receipt needs to exist in the form layout profile for the store. An example of a tender removal form layout can be downloaded and imported into the Site Manager.</p>
        <p>A variable for Description was added to the Float entry section in the Receipt designer.</p>
        <p>"Credit memo serial number" variable has been removed from Receipt designer. This variable will still work when printing an older form layout design. </p>
        <p>A new section has been added to the Receipt designer for Gift cards information. Previously the Credit memo variables were being used for both credit memo and gift cards. </p>
        <p>A new variable for Credit memo barcode has been added to the Credit memo section and the Credit memo serial number variable has been removed. Older forms that are using the Credit memo serial number variable will still work as before.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Form changes and additions</h2>
        <p>A form layout with specific information for a loyalty payment can now be printed separately (same as a customer payment slip or credit card slip) when the customer pays with a loyalty card. </p>
        <p>A new form type for Tender removal can now be added to the form layout profile. An example of the tender removal receipt can be downloaded and imported into the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span></p>

        <h1>Release notes 2017</h1>
        <p>In this version we have released the much anticipated Mobile POS for LS One. Included we have also added new service items in addition to standard retail items, major user interface improvements in the Site Manager and POS as well as started our work to support Power BI (LS Insight) as our future platform for Business Intelligence. This and much more will pleasantly surprise all our LS One partners when experiencing the latest release.</p>
        <h2>OMNI Mobile POS</h2>
        <p>Releasing the first omni product in our broad ecosystem strategy, the Mobile POS is a major milestone for LS&#160;One. LS&#160;One  platform is now a fully stateless platform that can support any number of devices whether standard POS or Mobile POS to connect at the same time. The Mobile POS runs on both Android and IOs. We look forward to get our partners and customer feedback on this very exciting development and more omni products will follow soon.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Inventory enhancements</h2>
        <p>Our partners have spoken and as always we have listened. Service items that allow customer to sell services by e.g. hour or work is now part of LS&#160;One. It complements the already support for retail items and variant headers that forms the basis anything being sold.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Power BI (LS Insight)</h2>
        <p>More and more customers are moving toward 3rd party BI tools as an alternative to standard reports. In LS Retail, our LS Insight product runs on Microsoft Power BI and LS One has beta release to selected partner. In this release we support sales and forecast reports together with a user friendly data schema to create user specific data visualizations. The official release for LS One Insight will be in release 2017.1</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>User experience</h2>
        <p>Our commitment to improve our LS One user experience is continuing. We have moved things around and so now all menus are available in the top ribbon in a much more intuitive layout. We have updated the styles in the POS to be much more aligned with the work that we have done in release 16.1 in the Site Manager.</p>
        <p><a href="UserInterfaceImprovements.htm">For more information about user experience changes read this</a>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Site Manager license changes</h2>
        <p>In this release we are introducing changes to the license mechanism of the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span>. </p>
        <p>Instead of getting a separate license key for the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span> and <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> now both systems are licenses through the same account key. </p>
        <p>This change will make the installation and activation of the <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> system much more efficient as well as the license maintenance and information for our customers and partners.</p>
        <p>Please see information on how to activate the license in the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span> with this new release and how to activate a demo license as well <a href="SiteManagerLicense.htm">here</a>. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>Many more improvements have been done in this release such as functionality to <a href="ReceiptImprovements.htm">email receipts</a> from the POS and other receipt printing enhancements and <a href="OtherImprovements.htm">more</a>.</p>

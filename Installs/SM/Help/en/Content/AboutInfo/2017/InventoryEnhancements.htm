        <h1>Inventory enhancements and changes</h1>
        <p>Our partners have spoken and as always we have listened. Service items that allow customer to sell services by e.g. hour or work is now part of LS&#160;One. It complements the already support for retail items and variant headers that forms the basis anything being sold.</p>
        <p>This page includes all changes that were done to the inventory including smaller improvements and bug fixes that are specifically for the inventory functionality</p>
        <h2>Service items</h2>
        <p>Functionality for service items has now been added to <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One">LS One</span>. Service items are very useful when customers need to sell items such as modifications, repairs or any service that does not involve actual stock being sold.</p>
        <p>When creating a new item in the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span> a new option has been added where the item can be created as a service item. A service item is handled the same as any item with in the <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> with the exception that it will not generate any inventory movements. On-hand inventory for these items will always be zero. Service items can be added to customer orders in the <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> as any other items can be.</p>
        <p>Within the inventory functionality in the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span> these items will not be visible at any time as they cannot create or maintain inventory movements.</p>
        <p>An existing retail item can be converted into a service item through a special dialog on the item card. If the retail item already has on hand inventory then the user changing the item needs a specific permission, Manage item types, to be able to change it. If the item on the other hand has no on hand inventory a normal Manage retail items permission is enough. When changing an item from retail item to a service item the functionality will create inventory adjustments to clear out (zero out)&#160;the inventory for the item which is the reason for the special permission.</p>
        <p>If an item that is changed to be a service item has already been added to a purchase order or stock counting journal the functionality will not stop the user from changing the item to a service item but the inventory will display the item with a strike through text and not include the item when the purchase order, goods receiving document and etc. are posted.</p>
        <p>When opening up the item card in the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span> for a service item the Vendor tab, Replenishment and Inventory tabs are disabled.</p>
        <h2>Deleted items and service items</h2>
        <p>If an item that has already been added to a purchase order, goods receiving document, inventory adjustment, purchase order worksheet or any of the other inventory documents is either deleted or changed to a service item those items will be displayed with a strike through text and will then not be included in the posting procedure when the document is posted or a goods receiving document is created from a purchase order for example.</p>
        <h2>User experience changes</h2>
        <p>All lists where previously the coloring of the line was used indicate a status of the inventory documents have now been changed to have an icon in the at the beginning of every line to indicate the status. An example of these icons would be a dark circle with a check mark to indicate posted documents and then circles with various other colors to indicate other statuses.</p>
        <p><a href="../../Resources/Images/SiteManager/Inventory/Dot_Blue.png"><img src="../../Resources/Images/SiteManager/Inventory/Dot_Checkmark.png" /><img src="../../Resources/Images/SiteManager/Inventory/Dot_Blue.png" /></a>
        </p>
        <p><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Purchase orders</b>
        </p>
        <p>Gray circle: Open purchase order</p>
        <p>Dark circle with a check mark:&#160;Posted purchase order</p>
        <p><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Goods receiving document</b>
        </p>
        <p>Gray circle: Open document</p>
        <p>Yellow circle: Partially received</p>
        <p>Dark circle with a check mark: Posted goods receiving document</p>
        <p>The indication of if the received quantity is the same, less then or greater than ordered have also been changed to be text color rather then cell color.</p>
        <p><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Stock counting journal</b>
        </p>
        <p>Gray circle: Open document</p>
        <p>Yellow circle: Partially posted</p>
        <p>Dark circle with a check mark: Closed</p>
        <p>The indication of if the counted quantity is the same, less then or greater than the on hand inventory has also been changed to be text color rather then cell color.</p>
        <h2>Other improvements</h2>
        <p>If a <a href="../../FieldHelp/Inventory/VendorView.htm">vendor</a> is deleted (archived) it is not visible anymore in any combo boxes or lists in the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span></p>
        <p>When creating a <a href="../../FieldHelp/Inventory/PurchaseOrderLineDialog.htm">purchase order line</a> for a vendor item that has a default purchase price the purchaser order line dialog will retrieve the vendors purchase price</p>
        <p>When doing a stock counting in another unit than inventory unit the difference of the current on-hand inventory and the counted stock was not calculated correctly</p>
        <p>When 'return item' was used to return an item the inventory was decreased instead of increased. This has now been fixed so the return item and return transaction operations behave the same.</p>
        <p>A data scroller has been added to the <a href="../../FieldHelp/Replenishment/PurchaseWorksheetView.htm">purchase order worksheets</a> to limit the number of items that are retrieved through the site service into the worksheet.</p>
        <p>When adding items to a <a href="../../FieldHelp/Inventory/InventoryTransferRequestItemDialog.htm">transfer request</a> or <a href="../../FieldHelp/Inventory/InventoryTransferOrderItemDialog.htm">order</a> and a new unit is selected the Site Manager will now prompt the user for a unit conversion.</p>
        <p>Inventory unit is now selected by default when adding item to inventory transfer requests and orders.</p>
        <p>When <a href="../../FieldHelp/Inventory/InventoryTransferOrdersView.htm">transfers orders</a> had more "sent" quantity then "received" quantity the information about the transfer was still being displayed in <a href="../../FieldHelp/Inventory/InventoryInTransitView.htm">Inventory in transit</a>. Now once the transfer has been marked as Recieved it will not be displayed in this view anymore. This change will affect transfers that were created in previous releases of <span class="MyVariablesLS&#160;One POS">LS&#160;One POS</span> as this was a database issue not user interface issue.</p>
        <p>When importing an excel stock counting sheet the store ID column for the stock counting journal header is now a mandatory column</p>
        <p>When deleting <a href="../../FieldHelp/LookupValues/UnitsView.htm">units</a> now conversion rules are checked to make sure that no rule is using the unit when deleting it. The system also checks if the unit is being used in any inventory process</p>
        <p>Now inventory levels for an item for all stores can be viewed with Site Manager set on a specific store not only Head office. If the <span class="MyVariablesSite Manager">Site Manager</span> is configured to be on a specific store the on hand information for that store is displayed in bold</p>
        <p>When a stock counting journal is deleted now all the stock counting lines are also deleted (not just the header as before).</p>
        <p>If an <a href="../../FieldHelp/Replenishment/InventoryTemplateView.htm">inventory template</a> has an open purchase worksheet on it then the template cannot be deleted. Please note that a worksheet is considered open until it is cleared by "Posting" it.</p>
        <p>When editing vendors for a specific item the OK button was not being enabled and disabled properly.</p>
        <p>When creating new Stock reservation lines and Inventory adjustment lines the unit description is now displayed in the list view.</p>
        <p>Edit button on purchase order worksheets list is now disabled if the list is empty and when no worksheet is selected</p>
        <p>When importing an excel stock counting sheet the store ID column for the stock counting journal header is now a mandatory column</p>

        <h1>LS One 2017.2 – Mobile Inventory is here!</h1>
        <p>It’s with great pleasure that the LS One team announces the release of LS One 2017.2. Having Mobile Inventory is essential to any Retail store and we are proud to introduce the latest omni channel application, LS One Mobile Inventory. Our customers will remember that earlier this year we released the first omni application, LS One Mobile POS.</p>
        <h2>Mobile Inventory</h2>
        <p>Mobile Inventory is one of the most popular application from LS Omni with good reason. It puts the power in the hands of retailers and their staff managing the day-to-day business. In the LS One Mobile Inventory you can take stock, create purchase orders, check in stock when an order is received as well as transfer items between stores within your organization. To have either LS One Mobile POS or Inventory connected to LS One, you need to install the LS Omni Server for back-end integration.</p>
        <p>See the prices for all LS One mobile applications on the  LS Retail Portal.</p>
        <h2>Forecourt aka Fuel Stations</h2>
        <p>We need to remind our customers that LS One supports the new LS Forecourt controller which make it the perfect solution for small to midsize fuel stations with kiosk and want and integrated Forecourt manager where you can control fuel pumps embedded in the Point-of-Sales. Start, Stop any pump and sell fuel directly in the LS One POS.</p>
        <h2>Power BI template</h2>
        <p>We have created a Power BI data model template for LS One. Just connect to a LS One, SQL database from within Power BI (online or desktop) and create your own sales graph. Included is also a sample Sales Graph. The template can be downloaded from the Partner Portal.</p>
        <h2>MyTimePlan</h2>
        <p>MyTimePlan is an exciting staff planning and shift management web application and is now fully integrated into LS One. You can find details of the latter on the AppExchange accessible from within the Site Manager.</p>
        <h2>Help and Code Samples</h2>
        <p>The development help has been moved online. The Integration Framework created in release 17.1 now has a well-documented API with examples.</p>
        <h2>Other Improvements</h2>
